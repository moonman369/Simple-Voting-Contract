# Basic Overview

This is a simple EVM compatible voting smart contract built using solidity. This contract is based on the famous `3_Ballot.sol` contract that is provided by  `Remix IDE` as an example.
This contract basically implements different functions for every action that takes place in a Voting Ballot. Also, it is important to note that there were certain drawbacks in the `Ballot.sol` contract, that I targeted and duly fixed in my `SimpleVoting.sol` contract.

# Key Features

So, as we know, a basic voting contract has the following functionalities:
- `Creation of Voting Ballot`: Where all the competing proposals and the Chairperson of the Ballot are set
- `Give Right to Vote`: Which can only be called by the Chairperson of the Voting Ballot.
- `Vote`: The most pivotal functionality possessed by a voting contract, can be called by any address with a right to vote.
- `Delegate`: A very interesting property that allows a voter to themselves abstain from voting and transfer that vote to another voter.
- `Compute and display winning proposal`: To compute and display the details of the winning proposal at the end of the voting process.
